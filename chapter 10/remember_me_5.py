"""
10-13: Verify User
The final listing for remember_me.py assumes either that the user has already entered their
username or that the program is running for the first time. We should modify it in case the
current user is not the person who last used the program. Before printing a welcome back
message in greet_user(), ask the user if this is the correct username.
If itâ€™s not, call get_new_username() to get the correct username.
